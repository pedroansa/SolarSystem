# Solar System Simulation

This project was developed as a college assignment to teach us about transformation matrices. The goal was to implement a simulation of the Solar System, including the Sun, Earth, Moon, and all the planets from Mercury to Uranus. Additionally, a dynamic camera was added for a more interactive experience.

## Features

- Implemented Sun, Earth, Moon, and all planets from Mercury to Uranus.
- Added a dynamic camera for a more interactive user experience.
- Demonstrates the use of transformation matrices for realistic planet movements.

## Usage

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Normally executing the Cmake file should make the dependencies work

## Controls

- W S A D controlls the position of the camera
- Space bar to go Up 
- Left crtl to go down
- Mouse to change the perspective direction

## Notes

- The proportions of the planets are illustrative and may not be to scale.
- Rotation and translation mechanisms are functioning correctly.

## Future Improvements

- Add a skybox and a controll to the speed of the simulation
