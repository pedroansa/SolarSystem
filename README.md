# SolarSystem

## Sumary
In this document we will discuss and present the results of the development of the OpenGL project propose in the course as well as all the difficulties and learning aspects that Iâ€™ve had in the execution of the exercise.

## Exercises
We were asked to develop one OpenGL exercise, following the steps listed in the document TP00-OpenGL.pdf that described two major projects to improve our knowledge of OpenGL and computer graphics. The first exercise was made in class with the help of the professor and consisted in draw a triangle with OpenGL and C++ and rasterize the vertex with color using Vertex and Fragment Shaders.

The great challenge was the second exercise that consist in doing the same thing, but instead of a static and colorful triangle, we should draw a mini Solar System with 3 spheres and using Textures for the planets and animations to simulate the movement of the planet.
